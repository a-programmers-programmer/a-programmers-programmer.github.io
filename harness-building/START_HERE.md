# START HERE - Wedding Books Project

**Welcome!** You've been asked to help with this project. This document will get you oriented.

## What Is This Project?

**Mission:** Create 20 personalized story books as wedding gifts for guests traveling to a rural Colorado wedding on **March 14, 2026**.

**Purpose:** Each book celebrates one person's friendship with the user, expressing appreciation for making the journey and compensating for limited face time during the 3-night wedding.

**Format:** Physical printed book + HTML multimedia version

**Approach:** LLM-powered harness with 5 sub-agents working in parallel to optimize user's time.

## Current Status

**👉 Always check `CURRENT_STATUS.md` first for the latest project state.**

That file tells you:
- What phase we're in
- What's been completed recently
- What's in progress (and who's working on it)
- What's next
- Any blockers

## Your Mission

**Pick a task and complete it.**

### Step 1: Understand the Context

Read these files to get oriented (in order):

1. **`CURRENT_STATUS.md`** - Where we are right now
2. **`REFINED_HARNESS_PLAN.md`** - Complete project plan (v2.0)
3. **`context/user_context.md`** - User's character, ADHD needs, relationship patterns
4. **`context/round_01_synthesis.md`** - Key insights from user feedback

Optional (for deeper context):
- `feedback-rounds/round_01_responses.md` - User's strategic answers
- `feedback-rounds/round_02_responses.md` - User's tactical answers
- `sub-agent-input/gemini_input.md` - Gemini's strategic input
- `sub-agent-input/chatgpt_input.md` - ChatGPT's strategic input

### Step 2: Pick a Task

Open **`TASKS.md`** and find a task that:
- Matches your capabilities (Gemini, ChatGPT, or Either)
- Is marked "Not Started" or "📝 needs creation"
- Has no prerequisites, or prerequisites are complete
- Is not currently "In Progress" by someone else (check `CURRENT_STATUS.md`)

### Step 3: Claim the Task

Update **`CURRENT_STATUS.md`**:
- Add your task to "In Progress" section
- Include your identifier (e.g., "Gemini Agent - Dec 15")
- Commit this change to GitHub

This prevents duplicate work.

### Step 4: Build It

1. Find the template in `templates/` directory (if applicable)
2. Read any referenced context documents
3. Build the material according to the template and plan
4. Save your work in `materials/` directory
5. Follow quality standards from the plan

### Step 5: Complete the Task

1. Update **`CURRENT_STATUS.md`**:
   - Move task from "In Progress" to "Recently Completed"
   - Add completion timestamp

2. Update **`TASKS.md`**:
   - Change status to "✅ Complete" or check the box

3. Commit everything to GitHub with clear commit message

4. If this was the last task in a phase, note that in `CURRENT_STATUS.md`

## Key Principles

✅ **Authenticity > Structure** - Emotional truth wins
✅ **Person-Specific** - Each book is unique, not generic
✅ **User's Voice** - Irreverent, self-aware, humorous, specific details
✅ **ADHD-Friendly** - One question at a time, explain why, conversational
✅ **Wedding Context** - These are thank you gifts for guests making the journey
✅ **Surprise** - No one knows, including Bailey (the fiancée)
