# Round 2 Responses - Tactical & Logistics

**Date:** Harness-building feedback, Round 2

---

## Question 1: Wedding Timeline

**Answer:**

**Wedding Date:** March 14, 2026

**Timeline:** Approximately 3 months from now (mid-December 2025 to mid-March 2026)

**Buffer needed:** Time for getting nice books bound professionally

**Implications:**
- Need to account for binding/printing time (likely 1-2 weeks minimum)
- Effective working time: ~2.5 months for content creation
- 20 books in 2.5 months = aggressive timeline
- May need parallel production approach
- Quality cannot be compromised (these are wedding gifts)

**Timeline breakdown estimate:**
- Harness building: 1-2 weeks
- Pilot book (test process): 1 week
- Production (19 remaining books): 6-8 weeks
- Buffer for revisions: 1 week
- Binding/printing: 1-2 weeks
- Total: ~11-13 weeks (fits within 3-month window with tight execution)

## Question 2: Book Format

**Answer:**

**Dual format:**
1. **Physical printed book** (primary gift)
2. **Digital copy in cool HTML format with multimedia**

**Implications:**

**For physical book:**
- Need to consider page count, binding style
- Professional printing/binding service required
- Timeline includes production time
- Content must work well in print format

**For digital HTML version:**
- Opens up multimedia possibilities:
  - Embedded audio (voice messages, music)
  - Photo galleries
  - Video clips
  - Interactive elements
  - Animations or transitions
- Can include content that doesn't fit in print
- Could be hosted or delivered as standalone HTML file
- Responsive design for different devices

**Production considerations:**
- Write content once, format for both mediums
- Some content may be print-only, some digital-only, most both
- HTML version could be "enhanced edition" with extras
- Need web development component for HTML formatting

**New harness materials needed:**
- HTML template design
- Multimedia integration guidelines
- Dual-format content planning
- Web hosting or delivery method

## Key Insights from This List

**Relationship patterns:**
- Mix of very long-term (Anthony - 13+ years) and work friendships
- Several "known since interns" (Dan Zhang, Roger, Alex)
- Work colleagues who became close friends (Dan Peek, Alex Georgis, Shashank)
- Family of choice (Anya, Anthony's sister)
- Partner (Bailey)

**Formative moments already emerging:**
- Anya's congrats vs. mother's money question = realization of deserving better
- Anthony making RuneScape account, calling to check on user
- Alex and Stacey including user despite "weirdness"
- Dan Peek as "big brother I never had"
- Shashank helping through back pain

**Pilot book candidates:**
- **Anthony** - Oldest friend, most history, best man (high stakes but rich material)
- **Dan Zhang** - Already have detailed example, good test case
- **Anya** - Powerful formative moment, clear emotional core

**Themes appearing:**
- Being included despite being different
- People who helped user grow
- Chosen family vs. biological family
- Work friendships that transcended workplace
- Support through challenges (back pain, career, personal growth)

## Question 4: Bailey's Involvement

**Answer:**

"It's a surprise. This is all from me and just to my friends :)"

**Key points:**
- Surprise for everyone, including Bailey
- This is user's personal gift to each person
- No collaboration or input from recipients
- Need to maintain confidentiality throughout process

**Implications:**
- All work happens privately with user
- No risk of spoiling surprise by involving others
- User is sole decision-maker on content
- Books are deeply personal, one-to-one gifts
- Bailey gets her own book as a surprise too

---

## Question 5: Voice Sample

**Answer:**

"Make a way of tracking outstanding tasks. We can handle the sample later."

**Decision:**
- Voice sample is optional, can be added later
- Use existing examples (Dan Zhang, Anthony, Anya stories) as voice references for now
- **Action item:** Create task tracking system for outstanding items

**Implications:**
- Need task/project management component in harness
- Track optional items that can be added later
- User wants clear visibility into what's pending

---

## Question 6: Production Approach

**Answer:**

**Approach: Parallel**

"Optimize for reducing my net time spent."

**Implications:**

**Workflow design:**
- User can interview for multiple people in same session
- Agents work on writing/organizing while user does other interviews
- Maximize agent autonomy, minimize user bottlenecks
- Pipeline approach: interview → organize → design → write → review

**Example parallel flow:**
- Week 1: User interviews for Person A, B, C
- Week 2: User interviews for Person D, E, F while agents organize A, B, C
- Week 3: User interviews for Person G, H while agents write A, B, C and organize D, E, F
- Week 4: User reviews drafts for A, B while agents write D, E, F
- And so on...

**Harness requirements:**
- Clear pipeline tracking (who's in what phase)
- Agent coordination to prevent conflicts
- Batch interview capability (multiple people per session)
- Parallel writing by different agents or instances
- Review queue management for user

**User time optimization:**
- Batch interviews when possible (multiple people in one sitting)
- Agents work asynchronously while user is unavailable
- Review process can be done in chunks
- Minimize back-and-forth; get rich material upfront

**Meta-Observer role becomes critical:**
- Assess if interview material is sufficient before moving to next phase
- Flag gaps early to avoid re-interviewing later
- Quality gate at each phase transition
