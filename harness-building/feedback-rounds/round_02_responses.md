## Question 1: Wedding Timeline

**Answer:**

**Wedding Date:** March 14, 2026

**Timeline:** Approximately 3 months from now (mid-December 2025 to mid-March 2026)

**Buffer needed:** Time for getting nice books bound professionally

**Implications:**
- Need to account for binding/printing time (likely 1-2 weeks minimum)
- Effective working time: ~2.5 months for content creation
- 20 books in 2.5 months = aggressive timeline
- May need parallel production approach
- Quality cannot be compromised (these are wedding gifts)

**Timeline breakdown estimate:**
- Harness building: 1-2 weeks
- Pilot book (test process): 1 week
- Production (19 remaining books): 6-8 weeks
- Buffer for revisions: 1 week
- Binding/printing: 1-2 weeks
- Total: ~11-13 weeks (fits within 3-month window with tight execution)

## Question 2: Book Format

**Answer:**

**Dual format:**
1. **Physical printed book** (primary gift)
2. **Digital copy in cool HTML format with multimedia**

**Implications:**

**For physical book:**
- Need to consider page count, binding style
- Professional printing/binding service required
- Timeline includes production time
- Content must work well in print format

**For digital HTML version:**
- Opens up multimedia possibilities:
  - Embedded audio (voice messages, music)
  - Photo galleries
  - Video clips
  - Interactive elements
  - Animations or transitions
- Can include content that doesn't fit in print
- Could be hosted or delivered as standalone HTML file
- Responsive design for different devices

**Production considerations:**
- Write content once, format for both mediums
- Some content may be print-only, some digital-only, most both
- HTML version could be "enhanced edition" with extras
- Need web development component for HTML formatting

**New harness materials needed:**
- HTML template design
- Multimedia integration guidelines
- Dual-format content planning
- Web hosting or delivery method
