## Question 1: Wedding Timeline

**Answer:**

**Wedding Date:** March 14, 2026

**Timeline:** Approximately 3 months from now (mid-December 2025 to mid-March 2026)

**Buffer needed:** Time for getting nice books bound professionally

**Implications:**
- Need to account for binding/printing time (likely 1-2 weeks minimum)
- Effective working time: ~2.5 months for content creation
- 20 books in 2.5 months = aggressive timeline
- May need parallel production approach
- Quality cannot be compromised (these are wedding gifts)

**Timeline breakdown estimate:**
- Harness building: 1-2 weeks
- Pilot book (test process): 1 week
- Production (19 remaining books): 6-8 weeks
- Buffer for revisions: 1 week
- Binding/printing: 1-2 weeks
- Total: ~11-13 weeks (fits within 3-month window with tight execution)
