# Round 1 Questions - Chunked for ADHD-Friendly Workflow

**Instructions:** I'll ask you these questions ONE AT A TIME. You can skip any question if you're stuck. Your answers will help refine the harness design.

## Chunk 1: Between-Visit Connections

**Question:** Beyond in-person reunions, what are the common threads that run through your episodic friendships *between* visits?

For example:
- Regular phone/video calls?
- Texting or messaging?
- Shared online activities (gaming, watching shows together remotely)?
- Inside jokes that persist over time?
- Sending memes or articles to each other?

**Why we're asking:** This will help us identify story material beyond just the visits themselves, and create better theme categories.

## Chunk 2: Core Emotions to Capture

**Question:** What specific emotions or feelings are *most* important to capture in these books?

Think beyond just "gratitude." What are the nuances you want to come through? For example:
- Deep appreciation for being seen/understood?
- Joy of reconnection after time apart?
- Comfort of knowing someone's always there despite distance?
- Pride in each other's growth?
- Bittersweetness of distance?
- Something else entirely?

**Why we're asking:** This helps us define what "emotional authenticity" means for your specific books.

## Chunk 3: Reflection & Memory Access

**Question:** How do you typically handle tasks that require reflection or deep thought?

Are there specific tools, techniques, or environments that help you focus and access your memories and feelings? For example:
- Music that brings you back to specific times?
- Looking at photos?
- Talking it out with someone?
- Writing stream-of-consciousness first?
- Walking or moving while thinking?
- Specific time of day when you're more reflective?

**Why we're asking:** We want to build the interview process around what actually works for your brain.

---

## Chunk 4: Epilogue Vision

**Question:** How do you envision the epilogue letters?

- Should they summarize the book's themes, or be a separate heartfelt message that stands on its own?
- Should the tone be consistent across all books, or tailored to each relationship?
- What's the main thing you want each epilogue to accomplish?

**Why we're asking:** This will help us create the right template and guidance for writing epilogues.

---

## Chunk 5: Sensitivities & Boundaries

**Question:** Are there any topics or memories that are off-limits or require extra care and sensitivity?

For example:
- Past conflicts that are resolved but still tender?
- Shared difficult experiences or traumas?
- Topics that might trigger strong emotions?
- Anything you'd want the LLM to handle with extra care?

**Why we're asking:** We want to build safeguards into the interview process and flag sensitive material appropriately.

---

## Chunk 6: Defining Meaningful Gift

**Question:** What makes a book a "meaningful gift" in your eyes?

What would make you feel like "yes, this captures what I wanted to express"? What would make the recipient feel truly seen and appreciated?

**Why we're asking:** This is our north star for quality - we need to know what success looks like to you.

---

## Chunk 7: Story Arcs & Themes

**Question:** Are there specific themes or story arcs you consistently want to explore across these books?

For example:
- How distance shaped the friendship?
- Personal growth witnessed by this person?
- Resilience through life changes?
- What "chosen family" means?
- The rarity of lasting connection?
- Something else?

**Why we're asking:** This helps us design better theme categories and narrative structure guidance.

---

## Chunk 8: Authenticity vs. Structure

**Question:** When there's tension between emotional authenticity and maintaining a structured narrative, which should take precedence?

For example: If a memory is emotionally powerful but doesn't fit neatly into the story arc, should we prioritize the emotion or the structure?

**Why we're asking:** This helps us guide the Narrative Designer and Story Writer on how to make trade-off decisions.
