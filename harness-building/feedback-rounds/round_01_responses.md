## Question 1: Between-Visit Connections

**Answer:**

**Common threads between visits:**
- Gaming for a handful of friends
- Occasional phone calls
- Deep conversations and long dinners when in town, usually with an activity
- Hanging out on Friendsgiving and other holidays, birthdays
- User usually takes people out for fancy dinners

**Example: Dan Zhang**

Met Dan at a party in 2015 when both were interns. User invited him to Facebook holiday party since he also liked free food and parties.

**Memories (not in chronological order):**
- As interns: Dan asked if user wanted alcohol. User gave him $20 and asked to "get me as drunk as possible." Dan came back with massive container of peach schnapps he got on sale. "It was amazing."
- Saw the best holiday parties together
- Dan once smoked prime rib for user and Bailey
- Dan taught user about what a PhD actually does, helped balance worldview of people in academia
- Dan and his wife (Stella) are both friends with Bailey and user
- They came on Bailey's bar trip to Greece
- Dan told user about LLMs in mid-2022
- User had dinner with Dan when visiting Seattle
- User and Dan had fun phone call while user was waiting for massively delayed flight out of SF
- Dan and Stella send Christmas cards with their adorable cats

- User guided Dan through interactions with a VP that helped him out
- They talk about work, tech, and weird people dynamics
- Over dinner, Dan told user about his colleague (who user happened to know) who was in a polycule with AI researchers. Dan appreciated venting about it
- Lots of inside jokes

**User's Character/Social Scripts:**

User describes themselves as "quite a character" who doesn't know social norms and doesn't care about violating them when they do, "much to the amusement of my friends."

**Example:** "If I was drunk, could I do this?" *proceeds to do pushups*

**Episodic memories could also contain "scripts" used to interact with people:**
- Practiced lines and stories, like comedy routines for social interactions
- Phases of drunk routine:
  - Pushups
  - Talking about Haskell
  - Getting oddly patriotic (e.g., singing national anthem)

**Conversation starters/character elements:**
- Carried a Big Gulp of champagne (3 bottles) at parties as both a drink and conversation starter
- Had a mohawk and was quite ripped for much of life, with a few years of variance
- Back in shape these days
