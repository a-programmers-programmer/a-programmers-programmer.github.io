# User Context for Harness Design

## Important Background

All sub-agents must understand this context when providing input on the harness design.

### Relationship Patterns

The user's friendships and relationships have unique characteristics:

- **Episodic, not continuous:** Most friends don't live nearby; they see each other periodically
- **Distance-based:** Friendships maintained across geographic separation
- **Frequent moves:** User grew up moving every 1-2 years, making long-term relationships rare
- **Limited childhood connections:** Only one friend from childhood; most relationships formed later
- **Family estrangement:** User is estranged from family
- **Chosen family emphasis:** These friendships represent chosen family, not assumed family context

### What This Means for Stories

- Focus on episodic memories and reunions, not continuous daily interaction
- Emphasize emotional development at different life stages
- Explore what makes connections persist despite distance and time
- Acknowledge the rarity and value of long-term relationships
- Celebrate chosen family
- **Do NOT assume childhood memories or family context**

### Working Style (ADHD)

The user has ADHD, which shapes the workflow requirements:

- **Single simple requests:** Ask ONE thing at a time
- **No list overload:** Never present long lists of tasks or questions
- **Bite-sized chunks:** Break everything into small, manageable pieces
- **Clarification welcome:** Ask for clarification when it could improve outcome
- **Progress indicators:** Show where in the process we are
- **Skip options:** Allow skipping if stuck
- **Context preservation:** Save everything immediately; assume context may be lost

### Book Structure

Each personalized book will include:

- **Chapters:** Story-based chapters using memoir and narrative techniques
- **Epilogue:** Direct letter from user to the person, expressing unsaid feelings and gratitude

### Goals

The books should be:

- Emotionally authentic and resonant
- True to the nature of episodic friendships
- Well-structured with narrative arcs
- Sensory and vivid (not just lists of events)
- Reflective of personal growth
- Meaningful gifts that honor these important relationships

## Your Role as Sub-Agent

When reviewing the harness plan, consider:

1. **Does the harness support the user's ADHD-friendly workflow?**
2. **Do the materials account for episodic friendship patterns?**
3. **Will the structure produce emotionally authentic books?**
4. **Are there gaps or missing elements?**
5. **What strategic questions would help refine the design?**

You can research and ask up to 2 rounds of questions (facilitated by the coordinator, who will break them into manageable chunks for the user).

Focus on **strategic, high-level questions** that will shape the harness design, not implementation details.
