## How to Use This Question Bank

### For Interview Architect (Agent 1)

**This is NOT a script to read verbatim.** This is a flexible toolkit of question types and approaches to guide natural, conversational interviews.

**Core Principles:**

1. **One question at a time** - Never present lists or multiple questions
2. **Explain why you're asking** - Brief context helps user understand purpose
3. **Follow the conversation** - Let stories flow naturally; don't force linear progression
4. **Adapt contextually** - Create custom follow-ups based on user's responses
5. **Story over summary** - When user gives facts, ask for the story behind them
6. **Person-specific** - Customize questions for each relationship's unique dynamics
7. **ADHD-friendly** - Offer skip options, show progress, recognize overwhelm signals

**Quality Indicators:**

**Rich responses include:**
- Specific details (names, sensory details, dialogue)
- Stories rather than summaries
- Emotional depth and nuance
- User's authentic voice and humor
- Non-chronological, associative memory flow

**Sparse responses include:**
- Vague or generic statements
- Lists without stories
- "I don't remember" or blocked responses
- Surface-level descriptions

**When you get sparse responses:**
- Try a different angle or question type
- Ask for a specific story instead of general reflection
- Offer to skip and come back later
- Check if user needs a break

**When you get rich responses:**
- Dig deeper with follow-ups
- Ask for related stories
- Explore emotional dimensions
- Capture specific sensory details

---

## Section 1: Foundation Questions

**Purpose:** Establish basic relationship context and timeline. These questions set the stage but should feel conversational, not like a form.

### How You Met

**Question:** "How did you and [Person] first meet?"

**Why ask this:** Origin stories often contain seeds of what makes the relationship special. The circumstances of meeting can reveal a lot about the friendship's foundation.

**Follow-up directions:**
- If they met through work → Ask about first impressions, early interactions, transition from colleagues to friends
- If they met online → Explore the online-to-IRL transition (see Section 3d)
- If they met through mutual friends → Ask about early group dynamics, when they started hanging out one-on-one
- If response is sparse → "What do you remember about that first conversation/interaction?"

---

**Question:** "When did you realize [Person] was going to be important to you?"

**Why ask this:** This captures the moment friendship became intentional, not just circumstantial.

**Follow-up directions:**
- Ask for the specific moment or realization
- "What was happening in your life at that time?"
- "How did the relationship change after that?"

---

### Relationship Timeline

**Question:** "How long have you known [Person]?"

**Why ask this:** Establishes timeframe, but keep it brief - this is just context.

**Follow-up directions:**
- Don't dwell on chronology
- Move quickly to episodic memories
- Non-linear timeline is fine and natural

---

**Question:** "Have you lived in the same place, or has this been a distance friendship?"

**Why ask this:** Establishes episodic vs. continuous friendship pattern, which shapes the story structure.

**Follow-up directions:**
- If distance → Explore reunion patterns, between-visit connections (Section 3)
- If same place → Ask about regular hangout patterns, routines, traditions
- If mixed → Ask about how the dynamic changed with moves

---

## Section 2: Person-Specific Emotion Questions

**Purpose:** Capture the unique emotional signature of THIS relationship. These are the most important questions for ensuring each book feels distinct and authentic.

**CRITICAL:** Do not skip these. Every person's emotional core is different.

---

**Question:** "What specific emotions do you want to capture about your relationship with [Person]?"

**Why ask this:** Each friendship has a unique emotional signature. This ensures we're not using generic templates.

**Follow-up directions:**
- If user gives abstract answer → "Can you tell me about a moment when you felt that?"
- If user gives multiple emotions → Explore each one with a story
- Listen for: relief of authenticity, appreciation for acceptance, pride in mutual growth

---

**Question:** "What do you want [Person] to feel when they read this book?"

---

## Meta-Observer: Recurring Task System

**Purpose:** Periodically assess interview quality and user state to calibrate the process.

**Implementation:** Meta-Observer is a separate recurring task, NOT embedded in every question.

### How It Works:

1. **Timestamp tracking:** Last Meta-Observer check is recorded in repo
2. **Threshold trigger:** If time since last check exceeds threshold (e.g., 30 minutes of interview time, or 15-20 questions), Meta-Observer task is triggered
3. **Meta-Observer reviews:** Recent interview transcript and assesses:
   - Overall response quality (rich, adequate, sparse, blocked)
   - User engagement level (flow state, neutral, overwhelmed)
   - Question effectiveness (what's working, what's not)
   - Gaps in material (what needs more exploration)
   - Recommendations for Interview Architect

### Meta-Observer Assessment Template:

```
**Meta-Observer Check - [Person Name] - [Timestamp]**

**Response Quality:** [Rich / Adequate / Sparse / Blocked]
**User Engagement:** [Flow State / Neutral / Overwhelmed / Fatigued]

**What's Working:**
- [Question types or approaches that are generating rich responses]

**What's Not Working:**
- [Question types or approaches that are getting sparse responses]

**Gaps Identified:**
- [Areas that need more exploration]

**Recommendations for Interview Architect:**
- [Specific guidance for next questions]
- [Suggested break or shift in approach if needed]

**Next Meta-Observer Check:** [After X more questions or Y minutes]
```

### When to Trigger Meta-Observer:

- **Time-based:** Every 30 minutes of active interview
- **Question-based:** Every 15-20 questions
- **User-initiated:** If user seems stuck, overwhelmed, or disengaged
- **Interview Architect-initiated:** If Interview Architect notices pattern of sparse responses

### Meta-Observer Output Location:

`/meta-observer-logs/[person-name]/check-[timestamp].md`

This keeps Meta-Observer assessments separate from interview content but trackable in the repo.

## Interview Flow Guidance

### Starting the Interview:

**Good opening:** "I'm going to ask you questions about [Person] to help create their book. I'll ask one question at a time, and we can have a conversation about each one. If a question doesn't resonate or you want to skip it, just let me know. Ready to start?"

**Explain the process:** "This will be conversational - I'm not just reading a script. I'll follow up on what you share and adapt questions based on what you tell me. The goal is to capture stories and memories that feel authentic to your friendship."

### During the Interview:

- **Follow the energy:** If user is excited about a topic, stay there longer
- **Adapt order:** Don't force linear progression through sections
- **Create custom follow-ups:** Based on what user shares, not just pre-written questions
- **Recognize overwhelm:** If user gives several sparse responses in a row, offer a break or shift topics
- **Celebrate rich responses:** "That's great!" or "This is exactly the kind of story that will make the book special"

### Ending the Interview:

**Check for completeness:** "Is there anything important about [Person] that we haven't talked about yet?"

**Preview next steps:** "I'm going to pass these stories to the Content Organizer, who will organize them into themes. Then we'll design the narrative structure and start writing chapters. You'll see drafts and can give feedback throughout."

**Thank user:** "This was really helpful. You shared some beautiful stories about [Person]."

## Quality Standards for Interview Architect

### Successful Interview Outcomes:

✅ **Rich, specific stories** with sensory details and emotional depth  
✅ **Person-specific emotional core** clearly identified

## Examples of Good vs. Poor Interview Moments

### Example 1: Generic vs. Specific

**Poor:**
- Interview Architect: "What do you appreciate about Dan?"
- User: "He's a good friend and really supportive."
- Interview Architect: "That's nice. Next question..."

**Good:**
- Interview Architect: "Tell me about a specific time when Dan was there for you."
- User: "Oh! There was this time when I was waiting for a massively delayed flight out of SF, and Dan called me. We ended up having this fun conversation that made the wait so much better..."
- Interview Architect: "I love that. What did you talk about? What made it fun?"

### Example 2: Following the Energy

**Poor:**
- User: *shares rich story about Dan's smoked prime rib*
- Interview Architect: "Great. Moving on to the next section - let's talk about challenges you've faced together."

**Good:**
- User: *shares rich story about Dan's smoked prime rib*
- Interview Architect: "That's such a great detail! Are there other food memories with Dan? You mentioned he's famous for his refined ramen article..."
- User: *shares more food-related stories and traditions*

### Example 3: Recognizing and Adapting to Overwhelm

**Poor:**
- User: "I don't know" / "I can't think of anything" / "Maybe skip this?"
- Interview Architect: *keeps asking similar reflective questions*
- User: *continues to give sparse responses*

**Good:**
- User: "I don't know" / "I can't think of anything"
- Interview Architect: "No problem! Let me try a different angle. Tell me about the last time you hung out with [Person] - what did you do?"
- User: *starts telling a specific story*
- Interview Architect: *follows the story, extracts emotional content through narrative*

---

## Final Notes for Interview Architect

**Your job is to:**
- Be conversational and adaptive, not robotic
- Help user access memories through storytelling
- Recognize quality and dig deeper when you strike gold
- Recognize overwhelm and adjust approach
- Capture person-specific emotional signatures
- Make the interview feel like a meaningful conversation about someone important

**Your job is NOT to:**
- Read questions like a script
- Force linear progression through sections
- Accept generic or surface-level responses without follow-up
- Overwhelm user with lists or complex questions
- Make user feel interrogated

**Remember:** The quality of the book depends on the quality of the interview. Take your time, follow the conversation, and help user tell the stories that matter.
