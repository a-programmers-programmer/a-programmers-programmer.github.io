## Sub-Agent Input Summary

### Gemini (Interview Architect, Narrative Designer, Quality Reviewer)

**Key Suggestions:**
1. Add "Shared Values & Beliefs" question category
2. Include guidance on non-linear timelines in narrative structure
3. Create a "Relationship Timeline" tool
4. Define specific quality review criteria for emotional authenticity
5. Add "Skipped Questions Log" to track why questions were skipped
6. Implement a "Mood Board" feature for visual/audio cues

**Key Concerns:**
- Emotional authenticity is the biggest challenge
- Context window limitations even with chunking
- Overall process may still be overwhelming despite ADHD-friendly design
- Heavy reliance on memory (which can be fallible)

### ChatGPT (Content Organizer, Story Writer)

**Key Suggestions:**
1. Expand Emotional Beat Library for episodic friendships and chosen family
2. Develop flexible epilogue letter template with prompts
3. Implement visual progress indicators (checklist/timeline)
4. Reorganize themes to better reflect episodic dynamics (e.g., "Reunion Reflections," "Distance Dynamics")

**Key Concerns:**
- Voice consistency across chapters and books
- Epilogue letters risk feeling formulaic
- Balancing cohesive narrative with episodic structure
- Current themes might not fully capture episodic friendship nuances
- Process might still feel overwhelming despite safeguards

## Questions Organized by Topic

### Topic 1: Understanding Your Relationships Better

**From Gemini:**
- Beyond reunions, are there other common threads that run through these relationships *between* visits? (e.g., regular phone calls, shared online activities, inside jokes that persist over time)

**From ChatGPT:**
- Are there specific themes or story arcs you consistently want to explore in these books? (e.g., resilience, growth, impact of distance on relationships)

---

### Topic 2: Emotional Authenticity & Expression

**From Gemini:**
- What specific emotions or feelings are *most* important to capture in these books? (Beyond just "gratitude" - what nuances of love, appreciation, or understanding?)

**From ChatGPT:**
- How do you prioritize emotional authenticity versus maintaining structured narrative? Are there instances where one should take precedence?
- How do you typically express gratitude or unsaid feelings in writing or speaking? Should this be reflected in the epilogues?

---

### Topic 3: ADHD Workflow & Memory Access

**From Gemini:**
- How do you typically handle tasks that require reflection or deep thought? Are there specific tools, techniques, or environments that help you focus and access memories?

---

### Topic 4: Epilogue Design

**From Gemini:**
- Do you envision the epilogue as a summary of the book or a separate, more personal expression? Should it be a "conclusion" or a heartfelt message that stands on its own?

**From ChatGPT:**
- How do you envision the tone and style of epilogue letters? Should they be consistent across all books, or tailored to each individual relationship?

---

### Topic 5: Sensitivities & Boundaries

**From Gemini:**
- Are there any topics or memories that are off-limits or require extra care and sensitivity when discussing with the LLM? (e.g., past conflicts, shared traumas)

---

### Topic 6: Defining Success

**From ChatGPT:**
- What constitutes a meaningful gift for you in the context of these books? How can we ensure each book fulfills that role?

---

## Key Concerns to Address

1. **Emotional Authenticity Challenge** - LLMs can sound emotional without genuine depth
2. **Formulaic Risk** - Epilogues and structure might feel template-driven rather than personal
3. **Narrative Cohesion** - Balancing episodic nature with cohesive story flow
4. **Overwhelm Risk** - Despite safeguards, process might still be too much
5. **Voice Consistency** - Maintaining your voice across different chapters and books
6. **Memory Reliance** - Books will be subjective interpretation, not perfect record

## Next Steps

The coordinator (Manus) will break these questions into bite-sized chunks and present them to you one at a time for feedback. Your responses will help refine the harness design before we build it.
